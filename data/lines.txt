still less must this kind of contentment which holds science in contempt take upon itself to claim that raving obscurantism of this sort is something higher than science
these apocalyptic utterances pretend to occupy the very centre and the deepest depths they look askance at all definiteness and preciseness of meaning and they deliberately hold back from conceptual thinking and the constraining necessities of thought as being the sort of reflection which they say can only feel at home in the sphere of finitude
but just as there is a breadth which is emptiness there is a depth which is empty too as we may have an extension of substance which overflows into finite multiplicity without the power of keeping the manifold together in the same way we may have an insubstantial intensity which keeping itself in as mere force without actual expression is no better than superficiality
the force of mind is only as great as its expression its depth only as deep as its power to expand and lose itself when spending and giving out its substance
moreover when this unreflective emotional knowledge makes a pretence of having immersed its own very self in the depths of the absolute being and of philosophizing in all holiness and truth it hides from itself the fact that instead of devotion to god it rather by this contempt for all measurable precision and definiteness simply attests in its own case the fortuitous character of its content and in the other endows god with its own caprice
when such minds commit themselves to the unrestrained ferment of sheer emotion they think that by putting a veil over selfconsciousness and surrendering all understanding they are thus gods beloved ones to whom he gives his wisdom in sleep
this is the reason too that in point of fact what they do conceive and bring forth in sleep is dreams
