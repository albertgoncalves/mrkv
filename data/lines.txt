still less must this kind of contentment which holds science in contempt take upon itself to claim that raving obscurantism of this sort is something higher than science
these apocalyptic utterances pretend to occupy the very centre and the deepest depths they look askance at all definiteness and preciseness of meaning and they deliberately hold back from conceptual thinking and the constraining necessities of thought as being the sort of reflection which they say can only feel at home in the sphere of finitude
but just as there is a breadth which is emptiness there is a depth which is empty too as we may have an extension of substance which overflows into finite multiplicity without the power of keeping the manifold together in the same way we may have an insubstantial intensity which keeping itself in as mere force without actual expression is no better than superficiality
